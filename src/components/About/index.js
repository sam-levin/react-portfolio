            <p>Hi, my name is Sam Levin. I'm 23 years old and living in Seattle, WA. I graduated from the University of Washington with a degree in Landscape Achitecture, but I figured out that it's not for me, so I decided to learn how to code. I'm currently a student in the UC Berkeley Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp, and this is my React Project. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
